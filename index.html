      <h2>Minister of Public Health's Tour and Key Decisions</h2>
      <p>The Minister of Public Health, Dr. Firas Abiad, completed his southern tour on November 7, 2023, where he inspected hospitals in Tyre, displaced persons shelters, and the Disaster Management Unit of the Union of Tyre municipalities, and assessed the readiness to counter any emergency. Furthermore, he closely reviewed the details of displaced populations, their locations, and the aid extended to them. During the visit, the minister made significant decisions, such as activating the emergency services of Qana Hospital to cater to the needs of the displaced, ensuring a resolution within 48 hours for facilitating childbirth for pregnant women, and activating the hotline 1787 to allow displaced persons to request medications promptly.</p>
      <p>The LRC in close coordination with UNICEF and MoPH has initiated and completed the children routine immunization campaign through Mobile Medical Units- MMUs in targeted areas in Tyre with high number of displaced persons.</p>
      <p>On November 9, the Disaster and Crisis Management Committee met in the North Governorate. The latest developments related to preparedness for current situations in Lebanon were addressed. Several key points were discussed during the meeting, including Dr. Suboon's presentation of the Ministry of Public Health's plan on the importance of preparing for any emergencies or developments in light of the current situation, as well as an assessment of hospitals and their categorization (red, yellow, and green). Representatives of the Lebanese Red Cross suggested suitable centers as shelters for displaced individuals in the region. The meeting concluded with the agreement to hold subsequent smaller meetings, including one with local associations in Tripoli, one for coordinating field operations, and one with district governors to coordinate crisis cells and the governorate's emergency operations room. Additionally, action points were outlined, such as sending a list of Civil Defense needs to the UNDP for comprehensive research and ensuring effective provision, as well as Crisis and Disaster Management Room coordinating with hospitals to gather necessary information for preparedness.</p>

      <h2>Visit and Discussions</h2>
      <p>On November 2, 2023, a visit was conducted by the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, accompanied by the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) unit and the Disaster Risk Management Unit (DRMU) at the Grand Serail. This visit included the South and Nabatieh Governorates, concluding it with a tour at the Union of Tyre Municipalities Emergency Operation Rooms.</p>
      <p>The primary focus of the discussions was the need to centralize coordination and collaborative efforts through the emergency operation rooms in the governorates, working closely with the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities and the DRMU. Emphasis was placed on the importance of the electronic platform designed for automating data collection and presenting it through dashboards and relevant tools. Furthermore, the crucially and effective role of the Lebanese Red Cross, especially in their capacity for developing surveys, managing data, and utilizing dashboards, was highlighted. It was also stressed that organizing and coordinating all NGOs through the administrative structure of the emergency operating rooms is essential to avoid duplication and ensure clear roles and services for each NGO. This approach aims to better address people's needs and enhance preparedness and response efforts.</p>
      <p>The visit to Nabatieh and the South Governorate showcased the support and ongoing preparedness and response work carried out by the DRR team of the Lebanese Red Cross, with detailed explanations and demonstrations of the dashboards and tools in use. The Ministry gained valuable insights into the ongoing efforts in both governorates, including a visit to one of the designated shelters in Tyre, where members of the Union of Tyre Municipalities were also present.</p>
      <p>The LRC is putting effort into centralizing coordination and collaborative efforts through the emergency operation rooms in the governorates, working closely with the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities and the DRMU. Daily reports on internally displaced persons are being provided to the minister.</p>
